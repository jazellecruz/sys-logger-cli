# sys-logger cli

A simple Command-Line Tool written in NodeJS. SysLogger displays the basic information about your system such as your operating system,
CPU, memory, and network info. 

My purpose in making this is to learn about creating CLIs using Node.js and to explore one of Node's internal modules, OS.

***NOTE***: This runs on v18.16.0 of Node.js.

## Usage

```shell
$ sys-logger [command] [options]
```

## Commands

```shell
$ sys-logger sys [options]  fetch and log system info
```

## Options

```console
--os-only     display only the os info 
--cpu-only    display only the cpu info
--mem-only    display only the memory info
--net-only    display only the network info
```
